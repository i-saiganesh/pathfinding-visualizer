## 💡 Overview
This project is a sophisticated visualization tool designed to help users understand pathfinding algorithms. It features a fully interactive grid where you can draw walls, move nodes, and watch algorithms find the shortest path in real-time.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-time Visualization:** Watch algorithms explore nodes and find the shortest path.
* **Maze Generation:** Automatically generates complex mazes using Recursive Division.
* **Interactive Grid:** Drag & drop start/finish nodes and draw your own walls.
* **4 Major Algorithms:** Includes Dijkstra, A* (Weighted), BFS, and DFS.

## 🧠 Algorithms Explained

| Algorithm | Weighted? | Shortest Path? | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Dijkstra** | ✅ | ✅ | Guarantees the shortest path; explores in all directions equally. |
| **A* Search** | ✅ | ✅ | Uses heuristics to find the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra. |
| **BFS** | ❌ | ✅ | Great for unweighted grids; explores layer-by-layer. |
| **DFS** | ❌ | ❌ | Fast but aggressive; does not guarantee the shortest path. |
